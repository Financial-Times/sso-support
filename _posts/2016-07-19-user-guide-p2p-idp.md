# Introduction
Single Sign On (SSO) means that, providing you are able to sign in to your company’s user account, you can sign in to your FT account without having to enter an FT account password.

# How to sign in to your FT account via SSO

Here's how you can view FT content directly on [www.ft.com](www.ft.com) or via an external FT article e.g. an email link or tweet. 

*Note - In order to log in via SSO you will need to log out of FT.com initially. The following link will ensure you are logged out: [Log me out of my FT account](https://accounts.ft.com/logout).*

  **1)** Providing you’re not already logged in to your FT account, when you select an FT article you’ll reach a barrier page, click **'Sign in here'** and you will be directed to the page below

  **2)** Enter your email address but leave the password field blank and click **‘Sign in’**

  **3)** You'll be re-directed to your chosen FT article

  *3A) You may be re-directed to your company's sign-in page; if you're not already logged in, and asked to enter your work username and password. (Please note: not your FT password). You will then be logged into your FT account and taken back to the content you selected.*

  *3B) You will need to follow the above SSO login process for each different device and/or web browser what you wish to access FT content. E.g. If you are signed in on Firefox, this will not log you in on a Chrome web browser.*

# Notes
* The new FT Single Sign On feature is available on [www.ft.com](www.ft.com) the [FT Web App](https://app.ft.com) and the Adroid app mobile platforms
* To test to the new SSO feature, please ensure that you are logged out of your FT account before you attempt to sign in via SSO. The following link will ensure you are logged out: Log me out of my FT account
* If for any reason you are unable to authenicate/login to your work account, you will be able to log in via the www.ft.com or log in page outside of SSO by entering your FT username and FT password
