# Introduction 
Thank you for taking part in our pilot to test our new FT Single sign on (SSO) feature for corporate users. 

## What is SSO? 
Single Sign On (SSO) allows a user who is logged in to one application 
to be able to log in automatically to additional applications. This 
means when you are logged into your company network this will allow you 
to be logged into your FT account and view content without having to 
enter your FT account password.
  
## Why are the FT providing SSO?
We are developing SSO to improve convenience for our users by reducing 
log in friction and to prevent users from having to remember additional 
passwords.

# How to use the FT SSO Service

When you next visit [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) or our new website [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com) directly, 
or click on an FT article via an external link (e.g. an email link, a 
link on twitter etc) you will be logged in through a "Discovery Service"
 via the FT's login page.

![FT Login Page](/sso-support/assets/images/login-page.png) 

* Please ensure that you are logged out of your FT account before you 
attempt to sign in via SSO. The following link will ensure you are 
logged out: [Log me out of my FT account](https://accounts.ft.com/logout)
* When accessing FT content you will be directed to the above page
* Enter your FT account Email address
* There is no need to enter your FT account Password, this field must be left **blank** in order to sign in via SSO
* Click ‘Sign in’
* *(You may be redirected by your organisation's identity provider (IdP) and asked to authenticate yourself by confirming your company account credentials - e.g. Your work Username AND Password)*
* You will then be redirected to your requested FT content and you will be
 logged in to access [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) / [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com)


_It is our intention to develop this page to improve the experience for SSO users going forward._

# Notes
* The new FT Single Sign On feature is currently only available on  [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) or our new website [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com)
* During the pilot, to access [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) and [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com) via SSO you will need to be able to authenticate yourself with your organisation’s identity provider (IdP) E.g. login to your company’s network with your work username AND password (Not your FT username and password). As with SSO a user needs to be successfully logged into one application before they are able to login automatically to additional applications.
* If for any reason you are unable to authenicate/login to your work account, you will be able to log in via the [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) or [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com) log in page outside of SSO by entering your FT username and FT password
* You will still be able to log in to the [FT Web App](https://app.ft.com) (e.g. via your mobile or tablet) or via the Android App by using your existing FT Username and Password
* We plan to add our SSO feature to the FT Web App and Android App soon to develop our mobile SSO access, along with additional features to improve the user experience of our FT Single sign on functionality.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## How long will the pilot last?
The pilot will last 30 days

## How many times can I test SSO?
SSO will automatically create a cookie that remembers your FT login credentials for a given device/browser for 6 month - If you would like to carry on testing the SSO feature, please log out of your account. The following link will ensure you are logged out: [Log out of my FT account](https://accounts.ft.com/logout)

## Will I be logged in on all my devices and different web browsers?
You will need to follow the SSO login process for each different device and/or web browser what you wish to access FT content. E.g. If you are signed in on Firefox, this will not log you in on a Chrome web browser.

## What support is available during the pilot?
Direct support will be available during the pilot, if you have any queries or encounter any issues please contact sso_support@ft.com  

## Will SSO work on my Mobile?
During the pilot, you will be able to use the SSO feature to access [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) and [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com) on your mobile or tablet device (providing you can authenticate yourself with your organisation’s identity provider (IdP) E.g. login to your company’s network.
However most users access FT on their mobiles using the FT Web App [(app.ft.com)](http://app.ft.com) (e.g. the FT ‘home screen’ icon on an IOS device) and the FT Android Native App. SSO will not be supported on these two applications during the pilot. However we hope to develop this functionality soon.

## What if my organisation has IP access to the FT?
If your organisation is set up with IP access to the FT, you are currently able to access the FT without having to log in to your FT account when you are in your organisation's IP range(s) e.g. when you're in the office.
 
We appreciate that as a SSO pilot user with IP access, you will still be able to view FT content when accessing the FT within your organisation's IP range without having to log in - However we don't want to turn off any IP access which would effect FT access for Clifford Chance users who are not taking part in the pilot)

For the period of the pilot, we are asking users to visit [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) or our new website [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com) directly and actively choose to **'Sign in'** to your account

**The benefits of logging in to your FT account are:**

- As a pilot user signing in via SSO you will be logged into your personal FT account, this allows you to benefit from the FT personalised features, e.g. My FT
- You will be able to login to [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) or our new website [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com) via SSO when you are outside your orgainsation's IP range (e.g. when you are out the office)
- It is possible for pilot users to login to [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) and [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com) via SSO using your mobile / tablet device. However the FT Web App [(app.ft.com)](http://app.ft.com) (e.g. the Iphone FT homescreen icon and the Android App will not be optimised for SSO for this pilot stage)

## What if I cannot log in to my organisation's sign in page?
If for any reason you are unable to authenicate/login to your work account (E.g. you have forgotten your work account username or password) you will be able to log in to your FT account via the [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) or [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com) log in page outside of SSO by entering your FT username and FT password

## What if I cannot log in to my organisation's sign in page?
If for any reason you are unable to authenicate/login to your work account (E.g. you have forgotten your work account username or password) you will be able to log in to your FT account via the [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) or [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com) log in page outside of SSO by entering your FT username and FT password

## What happens after the pilot?
After the pilot you will still be able to use the SSO feature to log in to your FT account. We plan to develop our SSO offering further and develop additional features to improve the user journey. E.g. SSO for the FT Web App [(app.ft.com)](http://app.ft.com)

At the end of the pilot we will send you a simple short survey to collect your feedback from using our SSO pilot feature. This information will help us determine our future development for SSO and improving convenience for our users
If you have any feedback during the pilot that you would like to share, please contact your Knowledge Manager and information will be fed back to us.
