# Introduction 
Single Sign On (SSO) means that, providing you are able to sign in to your company’s user account, you can sign in to your FT account without having to enter an FT account password.

# How to sign in to your FT account via SSO

Here's how you can view FT content directly on [www.ft.com](www.ft.com), on our latest news site [www.next.ft.com](www.next.ft.com) or via an external FT article e.g. an email link or tweet.

  1) Providing you’re not already logged in to your FT account you’ll reach a barrier page, click sign in and you will be directed to this page

  2) Enter your email address but leave the password field blank and click ‘Sign in’ 

  3) You'll be re-directed to your chosen FT article*
  
_*(If you’re not signed in to your company’s account on your device/browser, before being directed to your chosen FT article, you'll be taken to your company's identity provider sign in page and asked to enter your work username AND password (Please note: not your FT password) You will then be logged into your FT account and taken back to the content you selected._ 

# Notes
* The new FT Single Sign On feature is currently only available on  [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) or our new website [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com)
* To test the new SSO feature please ensure that you are logged out of your FT account before you attempt to sign in via SSO. The following link will ensure you are logged out: [Log me out of my FT account](https://accounts.ft.com/logout)
* If, for any reason, you are unable to authenticate/sign in to your work account, you will still be able to sign in via www.ft.com or next.ft.com by entering your FT username and FT password
* You will still be able to sign in to the [FT Web App](https://app.ft.com/) (via your mobile or tablet) or via the Android App by using your existing FT username and password
