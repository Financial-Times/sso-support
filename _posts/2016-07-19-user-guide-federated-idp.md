# Using FT SSO Service

There are two main ways available to log in via Single Sign On to view FT content. Our Discovery Service, or via a WAYFLess URL. 

## Discovery Service
When you next visit www.ft.com or our new website next.ft.com directly, 
or click on an FT article via an external link (e.g. an email link, a 
link on twitter etc) you will be logged in through a "Discovery Service"
 via the FT's login page.

* Please ensure that you are logged out of your FT account before you 
attempt to sign in via SSO. The following link will ensure you are 
logged out https://accounts.ft.com/logout 
* When accessing FT content you will be directed to the above page
* Enter your FT account Email address
* There is no need to enter your Password, please leave this field blank
* Click ‘Sign in’

You will be directed to your organisation’s Identity Provider, where 
you may be asked to log in using your company account credentials.

You will then be redirected to your requested FT content and you will be
 logged in to access [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) / [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com)

_It is our intention to develop this page so the password field will not be visible for SSO users going forward._

## WAYFLess URL access
A bespoke URL is provided will be shared with you. Simply click on this
 link and providing you are currently authenticated with your 
 organisation’s identity provider (IdP) you will be logged in to your 
 FT account and directed to www.ft.com / next.ft.com without having to 
 enter any additional credentials*

*If you are not authenticated with your organisation’s identity provider
 (IdP) or your IdP requests that you confirm your credentials. You will
  simply be redirected to confirm your identity (e.g. your 
  organisation’s log in page) when you click the WAYFLess URL before 
  being taken to www.ft.com / next.ft.com

# Notes
* The new FT Single Sign On feature is currently only available on  www.ft.com or our new website next.ft.com
* During the pilot, you will need to be able to authenticate yourself with your organisation’s identity provider (IdP) E.g. login to your company’s network, to access www.ft.com and next.ft.com
* You will need to be able to be authenticate yourself with organisation’s IdP to log in via the WAYFLess URL(s)
* You will still be able to log in to the Web App (e.g. via your mobile or tablet) or via the Android App by using your existing FT Username and Password
* We plan to add our SSO feature to the Web App and Android App soon to develop our mobile SSO access, along with additional features to improve the user experience of our FT Single sign on functionality.
