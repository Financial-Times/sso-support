# Introduction 
Thank you for taking part in our pilot to test our new FT Single sign on (SSO) feature for corporate users. 

## What is SSO? 
Single Sign On (SSO) allows a user who is logged in to one application 
to be able to log in automatically to additional applications. This 
means when you are logged into your company network this will allow you 
to be logged into your FT account and view content without having to 
enter your FT account password.
  
## Why are the FT providing SSO?
We are developing SSO to improve convenience for our users by reducing 
log in friction and to prevent users from having to remember additional 
passwords.

# Using FT SSO Service

There are two main ways available to log in via Single Sign On to view FT content. Our Discovery Service, or via a WAYFLess URL. 

## Discovery Service
When you next visit [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) or our new website [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com) directly, 
or click on an FT article via an external link (e.g. an email link, a 
link on twitter etc) you will be logged in through a "Discovery Service"
 via the FT's login page.

* Please ensure that you are logged out of your FT account before you 
attempt to sign in via SSO. The following link will ensure you are 
logged out: [Log me out of my FT account](https://accounts.ft.com/logout)
* When accessing FT content you will be directed to the above page
* Enter your FT account Email address
* There is no need to enter your FT account Password, this field must be left **blank** in order to sign in via SSO
* Click ‘Sign in’
* *(You may be redirected by your organisation's identity provider (IdP) and asked to authenticate yourself by confirming your company account credentials - e.g. Your work Username AND Password)*
* You will then be redirected to your requested FT content and you will be
 logged in to access [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) / [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com)

_It is our intention to develop this page to improve the experience for SSO users going forward._

## WAYFLess URL access
Please ensure that you are logged out of your FT account before you 
attempt to sign in via SSO. The following link will ensure you are 
logged out: [Log me out of my FT account](https://accounts.ft.com/logout)

A bespoke URL will be shared with you and will allow you to log in via SSO. 
 Simply click on this link and providing you are currently authenticated with your 
 organisation’s identity provider (IdP) you will be logged in to your 
 FT account and directed to www.ft.com / next.ft.com without having to 
 enter any additional credentials*

*If you are not authenticated with your organisation’s identity provider
 (IdP) or your IdP requests that you confirm your credentials. You will
  simply be redirected to confirm your identity (e.g. your 
  organisation’s log in page) when you click the WAYFLess URL before 
  being taken to [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) / [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com)

# Notes
* The new FT Single Sign On feature is currently only available on  [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) or our new website [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com)
* During the pilot, to access [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) and [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com) via SSO you will need to be able to authenticate yourself with your organisation’s identity provider (IdP) E.g. login to your company’s network with your work username AND password. As with SSO a user needs to be successfully logged into one application before they are able to login automatically to additional applications.
* If for any reason you are unable to authenicate/login to your work account, you will be able to log in via the [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) or [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com) log in page outside of SSO by entering your FT username and FT password
* You will still be able to log in to the [FT Web App](https://app.ft.com) (e.g. via your mobile or tablet) or via the Android App by using your existing FT Username and Password
* You will need to be able to be authenticate yourself with organisation’s IdP to log in via the WAYFLess URL(s)
* You will still be able to log in to the Web App (e.g. via your mobile or tablet) or via the Android App by using your existing FT Username and Password
* We plan to add our SSO feature to the Web App and Android App soon to develop our mobile SSO access, along with additional features to improve the user experience of our FT single sign on functionality.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## How long will the pilot last?
The pilot will last 30 days

## How many times can I test SSO?
SSO will automatically create a cookie that remembers your FT login credentials for a given device/browser for 6 month - If you would like to carry on testing the SSO feature, please log out of your account. The following link will ensure you are logged out: [Log out of my FT account](https://accounts.ft.com/logout)

## Will I be logged in on all my devices and different web browsers?
You will need to follow the SSO login process for each different device and/or web browser what you wish to access FT content. E.g. If you are signed in on Firefox, this will not log you in on a Chrome web browser.

## What support is available during the pilot?
Direct support will be available during the pilot, if you have any queries or encounter any issues please contact sso_support@ft.com  

## Will SSO work on my Mobile?
During the pilot, you will be able to use the SSO feature to access [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) and [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com) on your mobile or tablet device (providing you can authenticate yourself with your organisation’s identity provider (IdP) E.g. login to your company’s network.
However most users access FT on their mobiles using the FT Web App [(app.ft.com)](http://app.ft.com) (e.g. the FT ‘home screen’ icon on an IOS device) and the FT Android Native App. SSO will not be supported on these two applications during the pilot. However we hope to develop this functionality soon.

## What happens after the pilot?
After the pilot you will still be able to use the SSO feature to log in to your FT account. We plan to develop our SSO offering further and develop additional features to improve the user journey. E.g. SSO for the FT Web App [(app.ft.com)](http://app.ft.com)

At the end of the pilot we will send you a simple short survey to collect your feedback from using our SSO pilot feature. This information will help us determine our future development for SSO and improving convenience for our users
If you have any feedback during the pilot that you would like to share, please contact your Knowledge Manager and information will be fed back to us.
