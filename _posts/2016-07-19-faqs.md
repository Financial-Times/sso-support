## Will SSO work on my Mobile?
At this stage you will be able to use the SSO feature to access [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) and [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com) on your mobile or tablet device (providing you can authenticate yourself with your organisation’s identity provider (IdP) E.g. login to your company’s network.
However most users access FT on their mobiles using the FT Web App [(app.ft.com)](http://app.ft.com) (e.g. the FT ‘home screen’ icon on an IOS device) and the FT Android Native App. SSO will not be supported on these two applications during the pilot. However we hope to develop this functionality soon.

## Will I be logged in on all my devices and different web browsers?
You will need to follow the SSO login process for each different device and/or web browser what you wish to access FT content. E.g. If you are signed in on Firefox, this will not log you in on a Chrome web browser.

## What support is available if I have problem logging in?
Direct support will be available. If you have any queries or encounter any login issues please contact sso_support@ft.com  

## What if my organisation has IP access to the FT?
If your organisation is set up with IP access to the FT, you are currently able to access the FT without having to log in to your FT account when you are in your organisation’s IP range(s) e.g. when you’re in the office.
We appreciate that as a SSO pilot user with IP access, you will still be able to view FT content when accessing the FT within your organisation’s IP range without having to log in - However we don’t want to turn off any IP access which would affect FT access for users not using SSO)

**The benefits of logging in to your FT account are:**

- By signing in via SSO you will be logged into your personal FT account, this allows you to benefit from the FT personalised features, e.g. My FT
- You will be able to login to [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) or our new website [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com) via SSO when you are outside your orgainsation's IP range (e.g. when you are out the office)
- It is possible for users to login to [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) and [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com) via SSO using your mobile / tablet device. However the FT Web App [(app.ft.com)](http://app.ft.com) (e.g. the Iphone FT home screen icon and the Android App will not be optimised for SSO for this stage)

## What if I cannot log in to my organisation's sign in page?
If for any reason you are unable to authenticate/login to your work account (E.g. you have forgotten your work account username or password) you will be able to log in to your FT account via the [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com) or [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com) log in page outside of SSO by entering your FT username and FT password

## What’s next for FT SSO?
We plan to develop our SSO offering further and develop additional features to improve the user journey. E.g. SSO for the E.g. SSO for the FT Web App [(app.ft.com)](http://app.ft.com)

You may receive a simple short survey to collect your feedback from using our current SSO feature. This information will help us determine our future development for SSO and improving convenience for our users. If you have any feedback that you would like to share, please contact your Knowledge Manager and information will be fed back to us.
