## Introduction
In order to support the different identity providers, we use a company to help with the integration - [Auth0](https://auth0.com)

## Prerequisites
For peer to peer integration we support the following enterprise IDPs:

* ADFS

## Organization ADFS configuration
In order for your ADFS server to integrate with FT.com SSO, you need to follow the instructions in the [Auth0 website](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/enterprise/adfs)

* Add our our realm identifier to your IDP configuration: `urn:auth0:financialtimes`
* Add our callback: `https://financialtimes.eu.auth0.com/login/callback`

You need to provide us with your `ADFS metadata URL` for us to configure the integration.
