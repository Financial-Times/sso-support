## Introduction
Peer to Peer SSO is an effort to integrate FT.com login capabilities with different types of enterprise IDPs.
In order to support the diverse range of enterprise identity providers, we use a company to help us with the integration - [Auth0](https://auth0.com){:target="_blank"}

## Prerequisites
For peer to peer integration we have experience with the following enterprise IDPs:

* ADFS

For any other IDP integration, please contact the [support team](mailto:B2B.CustomerSupport@ft.com)

## Integrating ADFS with FT.com
In order for your ADFS server to integrate with FT.com SSO, you need to add Auth0 and the FT as relying party trust. Follow the instructions provided by the [Auth0 website](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/enterprise/adfs){:target="_blank"}

* Our Realm Identifier: `urn:auth0:financialtimes`
* Our Endpoint URL: `https://financialtimes.eu.auth0.com/login/callback`

To configure your ADFS server on our side, we need to add you `ADFS metadata URL` to our systems.
Please provide us with this URL to complete the integration.
