## Introduction
Peer to Peer SSO is an effort to integrate FT.com SSO with differnt types of enterprise IDPs.
In order to support the different identity providers, we use a company to help with the integration - [Auth0](https://auth0.com)

## Prerequisites
For peer to peer integration we have experience with the following enterprise IDPs:

* ADFS

For any other IDP integration, please contact the [support team](mailto:B2B.CustomerSupport@ft.com)

## Your ADFS configuration
In order for your ADFS server to integrate with FT.com SSO, you need to follow the instructions in the [Auth0 website](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/enterprise/adfs)

* Our realm identifier: `urn:auth0:financialtimes`
* Our callback URL: `https://financialtimes.eu.auth0.com/login/callback`

You need to provide us with your `ADFS metadata URL` for us to configure the integration.
